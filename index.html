                    <p>
                        I am a junior student at NYU Shanghai, majoring in Interactive Media Arts with a
                        minor in Creativity & Innovation. I spent my freshman and sophomore years at the
                        Shanghai campus and I am currently in my junior year studying at the New York campus.
                        In the upcoming semester, I will be going on a new academic adventure in Abu Dhabi.</p>
                    <p>
                        During my university journey, the diverse campus environment has allowed me to make
                        friends and meet new people from various countries around the world. They have told
                        me stories and showed me many new things that opened my eyes to different perspectives
                        and cultures, helping me broaden my global awareness. I aspire to explore more countries
                        and embrace the vastness of the world in the future!</p>
