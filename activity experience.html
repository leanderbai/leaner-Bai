                I am the founder of a non-profit student organization, "Simple Culture." Our mission
                is to foster a vibrant and intellectually stimulating environment for students.
                We are dedicated to organizing various student competitions, including business
                simulations and Model United Nations, providing opportunities for growth and learning.
            </p>
            <p>
                As of now, "Simple Culture" proudly counts 23 active members, and we continue to
                expand our reach and impact. One of our notable achievements was successfully hosting
                the "Online National CBM Business Competition" with an impressive turnout of 300+
                participants.
            </p>
            <p>
                Throughout the preparation phase, I collaborated with other student organizations,
                secured sponsorships, and effectively coordinated internal team members to promote
                the competition. This experience highlighted my strong leadership and organizational
                skills, and it reflects our commitment to excellence at "Simple Culture.""

                This was an offline competition event organized by the business simulation club
                we established during our high school years at the school. The number of participants
                was around forty. This event has also been used as a promotional video for our school
                club."</p>
