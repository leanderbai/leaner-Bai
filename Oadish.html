                                    Our initial focus was fixing the <span>water drainage system</span>. We went through
                                    many designs such as having a two-story rack where plants could be placed on the
                                    bottom section to catch excess water from the plates/bowls to designing a more elevated
                                    tray with a spout.</p>
                            </div>

                                    During our user interviews and co-creation session, we found that people are more
                                    interested in the idea of <span>modularity</span>. The interviewees prefer to have
                                    a dish rack that can be easily stored but could also be used during occasions that
                                    requires more drying spaces. Therefore, we switched our focus in designing a dish
                                    rack that could function in a smaller household specifically towards <span>people living
                                        alone and doesn’t have much countertop space</span> .</p>

                                    Additionally, we conducted many tests and research to ensure that the measurements
                                    of the plate dividers are <span>universal</span>. Starting with initial iterations
                                    featuring solid bars, we've changed the design to <span>accommodate both plates and
                                        bowls</span>.</p>

                                    We also experimented with the design of the utensil holder. A common issue with
                                    many utensil box is that the air holes on the bottom are too wide that most chopsticks
                                    in the market won’t be able to fit. As a result, we also take chopsticks’ measurement
                                    into account when we’re designing the utensil holder.</p>
