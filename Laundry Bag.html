                        Design Process:</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Laundry Bag went through several iterations created in Fusion 360, as I aimed
                        to combine functionality with modern aesthetics. The final version is a result of
                        meticulous CAD modeling and ergonomic design, ensuring ease of use without compromising
                        on style.

                        </div>
                        <div class="txt">
                            <h3>
                                Frist Version:</h3>
                            <p>
                                There is no design at this stage, just an explanation of the concept about what
                                I think of this project. As a sketch it can be used as a reference in the next step
                                of the design.</p>
                        </div>

                            <p>
                                The second design has essentially taken the shape of the final version. In this
                                part, the biggest problem is how to open the lid without touching the basket, so
                                the final solution is to add a space on top of the basket. The next problem is how
                                to design the top lid, how to design the buttons and screens?

                        This project has been more than a foray into product design; it has been a lesson
                        in user psychology and market trends. The balancing act between cost efficiency
                        and technological advancement has provided a deeper understanding of consumer priorities.
                        As I prepare to bring the Laundry Bag to market, these lessons will guide the approach
                        to future innovations.
