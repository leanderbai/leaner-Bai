                        Design Process:</h3>
                    <p>
                        My goal for this project was to create a music web page called Blague. I conducted
                        market research, analyzed other music websites, and gathered user feedback to inform
                        the initial design and prototype. Blague's features were refined through iterative
                        testing, and I played a role in the entire product design process, from concept
                        to implementation, to align with our goal. After the launch, we continuously updated
                        the website based on user feedback to keep it fresh and relevant.

                    <p>
                        · Fix: Implemented a hierarchical structure with clear visual hierarchy, including
                        drop-down menus for streamlined navigation. Conducted card sorting exercises to
                        realign content with user expectations.

                    <p>
                        · Fix: Redesigned buttons and icons for distinctiveness and descriptiveness. Adjusted
                        interactive elements for improved visibility through shadows, borders, and color
                        changes. Simplified icons to better represent their functions.

                        hover effects. Utilized a varied color palette that aligns with the brand identity
                        for enhanced visual appeal.
