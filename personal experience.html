                    Personal Experiences at NYU Shanghai：</h2>
                <p class="p1">
                    Transitioning from a traditional high school in China to NYU Shanghai (NYUSH) profoundly
                    enriched my worldview. Immersed in a diverse cultural environment, I discovered
                    the vibrant spectrum of the world. I'd like to share a few memorable experiences
                    from my university years that have left a lasting impression on me.

                        1. Experience Studio at NYUSH
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        My most cherished memory at NYUSH was definitely the Experience Studio in my sophomore
                        year. At the beginning of the semester, our entire class spent a weekend in a beautiful
                        village near Bishan. As a Chinese person, it was an entirely new experience to see
                        the Chinese countryside through the eyes of my foreign classmates and sense the
                        locals' curiosity about them. We chatted with villagers, set off fireworks spontaneously
                        one evening, sang with strangers dining at our hotel, and shared thoughts about
                        ourselves and the future while huddled around a stove on a rainy night. It felt
                        like a scene from a movie, where we were all protagonists. This course bonded us
                        so closely that we became great friends, almost like a family. Every few weeks,
                        we would gather for a meal. In our junior year, even though some went to New York,
                        others stayed in Shanghai, and Liam went to Japan, we would still have "family gatherings"
                        whenever possible. This is a period I cherish deeply.

                    2. "Queer China" Course：
                </h3>
                <p>
                    A particularly enlightening course I took at NYUSH was "Queer China." Homosexuality
                    has always been a rarely discussed topic in China, but this class opened my eyes
                    to its existence in Chinese history. The course fostered a more inclusive and open-minded
                    perspective in me towards different communities.

                        One of my experiences was celebrating Thanksgiving with friends in our dorm. Everyone
                        brought something, and on Thanksgiving evening, we gathered, shared what we were
                        thankful for, and enjoyed a lovely dinner together.

                <p>
                    I also had many first time expriences in New York: shooting a gun, attending a concert
                    of my favorite singer, and watching my favorite team's NBA game. Each of these experiences
                    has been an integral part of my journey, broadening my perspectives and enriching
                    my life in ways I had never imagined.
